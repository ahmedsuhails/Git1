Good Morning Ms.Devika,

I recently came across the position of Software Quality Assurance Engineer through Linkedin.
I have 13 years of experience in Manual Testing and a bit of Automation Testing. As a qualified Software Engineer, I am sure I will be an asset for your company.

Please take a minute to go through the attached Resume for your consideration. It would be a pleasure if I can hear back from you regarding my job application.

Thanks,
Suhail Ahmed
